What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository contained within the .git directory is created.
files: HEAD config description
subdirectories: hooks info objects refs

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where we can organize the compilation of files that are appropriate for a single commit. So when working on multiple projects within a code base we can ensure we're only adding the files that tie in with a specific project or bug fix.

The working directory is where we can develop and test code out, but not all files might be changed for a single purpose at one time. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Practice and organization. Compare the files changed, their changes, to determine what qualifies to go into a well formed commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When working on new features, investigating a bug fix, working on a new page layout design. When working with multiple developers in the same code base at one time.
