How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Consice display of lines changed from one version to another. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy to find when bugs were introduced.
    Easy to recover a 'last known good' version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Human error - forgetting to make a commit when you should have.
    System failure - loosing a drive containing significant work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is a code version control system, programs being interactive changes affect multiple files.
    Google Docs is more of a file share system for collaboration.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is for pulling change history and seeing comments
    git diff uses commit id's to compare versions to see changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can see what changes you've made, and either correct them before committing or 
    if it's an extreme error revert and start again from scratch.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    First this class.
    Second for customized javascript used in the selenium engine
    Third, abstract fields for the posting engine.
