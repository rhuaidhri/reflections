When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on projects with other remote developers comes to mind.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be in the middle of a project and it's easier to deal with code conflicts in one pass than to have to deal with them on a daily basis.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are initiated on GitHub to replicate an existing repository for various development tasks.
Clones are replications held locally on machines for development.
Branches are different paths of development, bug fix, new features, change of layout etc.
