When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on projects with other remote developers comes to mind.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be in the middle of a project and it's easier to deal with code conflicts in one pass than to have to deal with them on a daily basis.
